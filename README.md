# Secure Random Generator #

This library has two main purposes:

  * to provide a common interface for different secure random generators
    available on the system
  * to normalize the bytes returned by the secure random generator for most
    common use cases, such as generating integers, floats or randomizing arrays

This library does not provide any additional secure random generators than what
is available via PHP extensions. The available sources for secure random bytes
in PHP are reading from `/dev/(u)random`, calling `mcrypt_create_iv()` or
possibly calling `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()`.

The security of the random numbers generated by this library is entirely
dependant on the underlying random generator. No additional transformations or
modifications are done on the bytes returned by the random generator (other than
what is required to normalize it for the use case).

The idea is to simply provide a simple interface for different secure random
generators to make it easier to provide support for different kinds of
platforms.

API documentation is [available](http://kit.riimu.net/api/securerandom/) and it
can be generated using ApiGen.

## Requirements ##

To generate secure random bytes, it requires one of the random byte generators
to be available. In other words, one of the following needs to be true:

  * /dev/urandom needs to be readable
  * Mcrypt extension needs to be enabled
  * OpenSSL extension needs to be enabled

Additionally, the library also has following PHP requirements:

  * PHP version 5.4

## Installation ##

This library can be easily installed using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)
by including the following dependency in your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "riimu/kit-securerandom": "1.*"
    }
}
```

The library will be the installed by running `composer install` and the classes
can be loaded with simply including the `vendor/autoload.php` file.

## Usage ##

Usage of the library is very simple. Simply create an instance of the
`SecureRandom` and call any of the methods to get random values. For example:

```php
<?php
$rng = new \Riimu\Kit\SecureRandom\SecureRandom();

var_dump(base64_encode($rng->getBytes(32)));     // Returns a random byte string
var_dump($rng->getInteger(100, 1000));           // Returns a random integer between 100 and 1000
var_dump($rng->getFloat());                      // Returns a random float between 0 and 1
var_dump($rng->getArray(range(0, 100), 5));      // Returns 5 randomly selected elements from the array
var_dump($rng->choose(range(0, 100)));           // Returns one randomly chosen value from the array
var_dump($rng->shuffle(range(0, 9)));            // Returns the array in random order
var_dump($rng->getSequence('01', 32));           // Returns a random sequence of 0s and 1s with length of 32
var_dump($rng->getSequence(['a', 'b', 'c'], 5)); // Returns an array with 5 elements randomly chosen from 'a', 'b', and 'c'
```

### Random methods ###

The following methods are available in `SecureRandom` to retrieve randomness:

  * `getBytes($count)` returns a string of random bytes with length equal to
    $count.
  * `getInteger($min, $max)` returns an random integer between the two given
    positive integers (inclusive).
  * `getFloat()` returns a random float value between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
  * `getArray(array $array, $count)` returns $count random elements from the
    given array. The elements are in random order, but the keys are preserved.
  * `choose(array $array)` returns a random value chosen from the array
  * `shuffle(array $array)` returns the array in random order. The keys are
    preserved.
  * `getSequence($choices, $length)` returns a random sequence of length
    $length. The $choices can be a string, in which case a string is returned
    or an array, in which case an array is returned.

### Notes about /dev/random ###

The generators provided by this library use `/dev/urandom` as the randomness
source by default. Reading from `/dev/random` provides no additional security
to typical PHP web applications and its blocking nature would make it very
unsuitable for such purposes.

There are only few legitimate cases where you should read from `/dev/random`
instead. This is mostly if you are concerned that `/dev/urandom` has not yet
been seeded properly. However, this is typically not the case with web
applications, since this tends to be issue only on system startup.

If you know, that you absolutely need to read from `/dev/random` it's possible
to set the `RandomReader` and `Mcrypt` to use it instead by setting false as
their constructor argument and providing the generator to `SecureRandom` in the
constructor. For example:

```php
$rng = new \Riimu\Kit\SecureRandom\SecureRandom(
    new \Riimu\Kit\SecureRandom\Generator\RandomReader(false)
);
```

## Available random generators ##

When `SecureRandom` is created, it will attempt to use one of the available
secure random generators, depending on which one is supported by the current
platform. Following random sources are available and they will be tried in the
following order:

  * `Generator\RandomReader` simply reads bytes from the random device
    `/dev/urandom`
  * `Generator\Mcrypt` uses `mcrypt_create_iv` to generate random bytes using
    `MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM` as the source.
  * `Generator\OpenSSL` uses `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes` to generate random
    bytes.

There has been some debate on whether the algorithm used by OpenSSL is actually
cryptographically strong or not. However, due to lack of concrete evidence
against it and PHP manual at least implying that the algorithm should be strong
(as long as the $crypto_strong value is verified), this library will use it as
the last fallback by default for better compatibility across systems.

If you wish to explicitly define the used byte generator, you may provide it as
the constructor argument for the `SecureRandom`. For example:

```php
$rng = new \Riimu\Kit\SecureRandom\SecureRandom(
    new \Riimu\Kit\SecureRandom\Generator\Mcrypt()
);
```
