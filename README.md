# Secure Random Generator #

*SecureRandom* is a PHP library for generating secure random numbers and using
them for common randomization operations such as shuffling arrays or generating
string sequences like passwords. Prior to version 7.0, PHP did not have built in
secure random functions, but it was still possible to use different sources of
randomness for generating secure random values. Thus, this library has two main
purposes:

  * To provide a common interface for different sources of secure randomness
    across different platforms and PHP versions
  * To make it easier to properly use the sources of randomness to generate
    random values and to perform common random array operations.

This library does not provide any additional secure random byte generators. It
simply uses the byte generators that are available to PHP via extensions or
internally. The four generators that are commonly available to PHP are:

  * CSPRNG functions provided by PHP 7.0
  * reading from the random device `/dev/(u)random`
  * calling the `mcrypt_create_iv()` function
  * calling the `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()` function

The security of the randomness generated by this library is entirely dependant
on the underlying random byte generator. The library does not do any additional
transformations on the bytes other than the normalization needed to generate
even distributions of random numbers.

## Requirements ##

  * The minimum supported PHP version is 5.6
  * The library depends on the following PHP Extensions
    * [`OpenSSL`](http://php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php) (To use OpenSSQL generator)
    * [`Mcrypt`](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mcrypt.php) (To use Mcrypt generator)
  * The `/dev/urandom` must be readable in order to use the Random reader generator

## Installation ##

### Installation with Composer ###

The easiest way to install this library is to use Composer to handle your
dependencies. In order to install this library via Composer, simply follow
these two steps:

  1. Acquire the `composer.phar` by running the Composer
     [Command-line installation](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
     in your project root.

  2. Once you have run the installation script, you should have the `composer.phar`
     file in you project root and you can run the following command:

     ```
     php composer.phar require "riimu/kit-securerandom:^1.3"
     ```

After installing this library via Composer, you can load the library by
including the `vendor/autoload.php` file that was generated by Composer during
the installation.

### Adding the library as a dependency ###

If you are already familiar with how to use Composer, you may alternatively add
the library as a dependency by adding the following `composer.json` file to your
project and running the `composer install` command:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "riimu/kit-securerandom": "^1.3"
    }
}
```

### Manual installation ###

If you do not wish to use Composer to load the library, you may also download
the library manually by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/Riimu/Kit-SecureRandom/releases/latest)
and extracting the `src` folder to your project. You may then include the
provided `src/autoload.php` file to load the library classes.

Please note that using Composer will also automatically download the other
required PHP libraries. If you install this library manually, you will also need
to make those other required libraries available.

## Usage ##

Usage of the library is very simple. Simply create an instance of the
`SecureRandom` and call any of the methods to generate random values. For
example:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$rng = new \Riimu\Kit\SecureRandom\SecureRandom();

var_dump(base64_encode($rng->getBytes(32)));     // Returns a random byte string
var_dump($rng->getInteger(100, 1000));           // Returns a random integer between 100 and 1000
var_dump($rng->getFloat());                      // Returns a random float between 0 and 1
var_dump($rng->getRandom());                     // Returns a random float between 0 and 1 (not including 1)
var_dump($rng->getArray(range(0, 100), 5));      // Returns 5 randomly selected elements from the array
var_dump($rng->choose(range(0, 100)));           // Returns one randomly chosen value from the array
var_dump($rng->shuffle(range(0, 9)));            // Returns the array in random order
var_dump($rng->getSequence('01', 32));           // Returns a random sequence of 0s and 1s with length of 32
var_dump($rng->getSequence(['a', 'b', 'c'], 5)); // Returns an array with 5 elements randomly chosen from 'a', 'b', and 'c'
var_dump($rng->getUuid());                       // Returns a random version UUID, e.g. '00056a74-036b-47c5-ab35-6f34a41a70ae'
```

### Random methods ###

The following methods are available in `SecureRandom` to retrieve randomness:

  * `getBytes($count)` returns a string of random bytes with length equal to
    $count.

  * `getInteger($min, $max)` returns an random integer between the two given
    positive integers (inclusive).

  * `getFloat()` returns a random float value between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

  * `getRandom()` returns a random float value between 0 and 1 that has 52 bits
    of precision and so that the returned value is always less than 1. In
    comparison to `getFloat()`, the value distribution is more uniform and not
    dependent on `PHP_INT_MAX`.

  * `getArray(array $array, $count)` returns a number of random elements from
    the given array. The elements are in random order, but the keys are
    preserved.

  * `choose(array $array)` returns a random value chosen from the array.

  * `shuffle(array $array)` returns the array in random order. The keys are
    preserved.

  * `getSequence($choices, $length)` returns a random sequence of values or
    characters. The choices can be provided as a string or an array. The type of
    the return value depends on the type of choices.

  * `getUuid()` returns a random version 4 [Universally unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).
     UUIDs are unique identifiers that can be generated randomly, independently
     and have very small likelihood of collision. And example of UUID could be
    `00056a74-036b-47c5-ab35-6f34a41a70ae`.

### Notes about /dev/random ###

The generators provided by this library use `/dev/urandom` as the randomness
source by default. Reading from `/dev/random` provides no additional security
to typical PHP web applications and its blocking nature would make it very
unsuitable for such purposes.

There are only few legitimate cases where you should read from `/dev/random`
instead. This is mostly if you are concerned that `/dev/urandom` has not yet
been seeded properly. However, this is typically not the case with web
applications, since this tends to be issue only on system startup.

If you know that you absolutely need to read from `/dev/random` it's possible
to set the `RandomReader` and `Mcrypt` to use it as the randomness source
instead by setting the constructor parameter to false and providing the
generator to `SecureRandom` in the constructor. For example:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$generator = new \Riimu\Kit\SecureRandom\Generator\RandomReader(false);
$rng = new \Riimu\Kit\SecureRandom\SecureRandom($generator);
```

## Available random generators ##

When `SecureRandom` is created, it will attempt to use one of the available
secure random generators, depending on which one is supported by the current
platform. Following random sources are available and they will be tried in the
following order:

  * `Generator\Internal` uses the internal functions available in PHP 7.0
  * `Generator\RandomReader` simply reads bytes from the random device
    `/dev/urandom`
  * `Generator\Mcrypt` uses `mcrypt_create_iv()` to generate random bytes using
    `MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM` as the source.
  * `Generator\OpenSSL` uses `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()` to generate random
    bytes.

There has been some debate on whether the algorithm used by OpenSSL is actually
cryptographically strong or not. However, due to lack of concrete evidence
against it and due to implications of it's strength in the PHP manual, this
library will use OpenSSL as the last fallback by default to achieve better
compatibility across different platforms.

If you wish to explicitly define the byte generator, you may provide it as the
constructor parameter for the `SecureRandom`. For example:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$rng = new \Riimu\Kit\SecureRandom\SecureRandom(
    new \Riimu\Kit\SecureRandom\Generator\Mcrypt()
);
```
